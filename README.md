# International Student Internship Placement System

## Process Automation Demonstration for Intelligent Agents and Process Automation

This project demonstrates automation of the interview scheduling process for international student internship placements. The system automates the matching of student availability with company preferences, schedules optimal interview slots, and generates notifications.

## Project Overview

The International Student Internship Placement System automates a critical HR process that traditionally requires significant manual effort. By leveraging process automation and AI techniques, the system:

1. Processes student and company availability data
2. Identifies optimal interview slots through intelligent matching
3. Generates an efficient interview schedule
4. Creates personalized email notifications

## Features

- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Automatically finds overlapping availability between students and companies
- **Optimal Slot Selection**: Prioritizes slots based on match quality and scheduling efficiency
- **Automated Notifications**: Generates personalized emails for both students and companies
- **Interactive Process Visualization**: Demonstrates the entire workflow from data input to final notification

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: JavaScript (browser-based)
- **Backend Implementation**: Python (separate component)
- **Process Modeling**: BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main application interface
- `styles.css` - Styling for the application
- `script.js` - Core scheduling and interface functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate through the demo by clicking the buttons at each stage
2. Observe how the system processes availability data
3. See how interviews are automatically scheduled
4. Review the generated email notifications

## Automation Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Reduces scheduling time from hours to seconds
- **Improved Matching**: Ensures students and companies meet at mutually convenient times
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates double-bookings and scheduling conflicts
- **Enhanced Experience**: Provides timely communication to all parties

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Machine learning for optimizing interview slot selection based on historical data
- Natural language processing for analyzing student skills from CVs
- Sentiment analysis of post-interview feedback
